# this is a comment; comments are ignored and so are empty lines
1 not a multiline string

2 first multiline \
string

3 second multiline \
string \
with more lines

4 several lines .. \
next line is empty: \
\
next has only a space:\
 \
next line has 3 spaces:\
   \
END

5 it is fine to sp\
it words, or really \
c\
h\
o\
p\
 them up!

\
6 start with backslash , fine with me but why?

# if there is a trailing char after the backslash that does not count as
# a multiline string
7 have a trailing space after backslash \ 
8 not part of the string no. 7

# keep this one last
99 will not get to this line 'cause input file line has no newline
