### Documentation Updates

The reference documentation for the [event](eventRecord.html) record type
has been updated to cover the use of named events which were added in Base
3.14.12.3 and 3.15.1.

Documentation for CALC expression evaluation has been updated for format
enhancements and to add some missing operators.
The best documentation for these expressions can be found in the
[postfix.h](postfix_h.html) header in libCom, but both the
[calc](calcRecord.html) and [calcout](calcoutRecord.html) record reference
pages also cover the infix expressions supported.
