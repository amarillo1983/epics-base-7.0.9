### Support for multiline strings in iocsh files

GitHub [PR #603](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/pull/603)

This update introduces support for multiline strings in IOC shell (iocsh) files.
Previously, string values in iocsh files were limited to a single line, making
it difficult to include longer or formatted text. With this change, users can
now define strings that span multiple lines, improving readability and
flexibility when configuring IOC shell scripts.

To create a multiline string, end a line with a backslash (`\`). The following
line, including any leading whitespace, will be joined to the previous line.
If the backslash is immediately followed by any character other than a newline,
it will not be treated as a multiline continuation.
