# New atInit Command Added

This pull request introduces a new IOC shell command `atInit` to EPICS Base, which allows users to schedule arbitrary commands to be executed automatically after the IOC initialization phase (`iocInit`).

The module allows you to write better-structured ioc shell files to include in your startup scripts without tracking where iocInit is located (and how IOC is deployed) e.g.:
- to achieve the best maintainability,
- to improve writing boot sequences,
- to improve IOC startup flexibility and scripting capabilities.

## Features

- Define commands that run after IOC initialization completes.
- Overwrites ```autosave``` to ensure proper configuration of the required PV.
- Supports any valid IOC shell command as an argument.
- Example usages:
  - `atInit "dbpf <PV> <VAL>"`
  - `atInit "date"`

## Testing

- Unit tests have been added to verify:
  - Registration and execution of commands scheduled with `atInit`.
  - Proper handling of empty or invalid commands without crashing the IOC.
  - Execution order and environment variable effects.

This note documents the functionality introduced in PR #558.
