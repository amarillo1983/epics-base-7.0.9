### New `atInit` IOC Shell Command Added

This release incorporates [PR #558](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/pull/558) which added a new IOC shell command `atInit`. This command allows startup scripts to schedule arbitrary commands to be executed automatically after the IOC initialization phase (`iocInit`).

`atInit` allows you to write better-structured IOC shell files to include in your startup scripts without tracking where `iocInit` is located (and how IOC is deployed) e.g.:
- to achieve the best maintainability (e.g. encapsulation of the context into one file),
- to improve writing boot sequences,
- to improve IOC startup flexibility and scripting capabilities,
- it replaces the community [`afterInit`](https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/iocsh_utilities/blob/master/afterInit.c) and [`doAfterIocInit`](https://github.com/epics-modules/std/blob/master/stdApp/src/delayCmd.cpp) IOC shell commands,
- community usage examples:
  - [`pf4filters.iocsh`](https://github.com/epics-modules/optics/blob/master/opticsApp/iocsh/pf4filters.iocsh) - enable/disable with a single comment ([full description](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/pull/558#issuecomment-2430057167))
  - [ALS-U autosave managment](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/pull/558#issuecomment-2430447220)

#### Features

- Define commands that run after IOC initialization completes.
- Executes following `iocInit` and `autosave` initialization (important for proper PV configuration).
- Supports any valid IOC shell command as an argument.
- Example usages:
  - `atInit "dbpf <PV> <VAL>"`
  - `atInit "date"`
  - `atInit "dbpf $(P)EvtClkSource-Sel 'Upstream (fanout)'"`
  - `atInit "dbpf $(P)Enable-Sel Enabled"`
