### Conflict-free release note entries for GitHub pull requests

GitHub [PR #628](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/pull/628)

This release replaces the developer-edited `documentation/RELEASE_NOTES.md`
source file in the EPICS tree with a process that generates one file from
individual files added for each changeset, thus preventing merge conflicts
when new entries are added by multiple pull requests.

For this new approach each pull request must add its own Markdown file to the
`documentation/new-notes` directory, using a unique filename.
When a release is made, all these files will be combined into a single
`RELEASE-<version>.md` file and the `new-notes` directory emptied to prepare
for development of the next release.

The build process now descends into the `documentation` directory where the
`RELEASE_NOTES.md` file is generated and installed into the `doc` top-level
directory along with the `RELEASE-<version>.md` files documenting older EPICS
releases going back to 3.15.

Between releases the generated `RELEASE_NOTES.md` file contains the text from
any `new-notes` files added to document changes already merged.
It also provides links to the older `RELEASE-<version>.md` files, so it remains
the starting point for documentation on all release changes.

Detailed instructions on creating new entries are provided in a `README.txt`
file in the `documentation/new-notes` directory.
The release-time process that generates a new `RELEASE-<version>.md` file is
described in the `documentation/ReleaseChecklist.html` file.
