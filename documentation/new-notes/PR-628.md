### Conflict-free release note entries for GitHub pull requests

GitHub [PR #628](https://github.com/epics-base/epics-base/pull/628)

This release replaces the single `documentation/RELEASE_NOTES.md` file in the
EPICS source tree with a mechanism that should prevent merge conflicts when new
entries are added from multiple pull requests.

In this new approach each pull request will add a separate Markdown file to the
`documentation/new-notes` directory with a unique name.
Instructions on creating new entries are provided in a `README.txt` file in the
`documentation/new-notes` directory.

All these files will be combined into a single `RELEASE-<version>.md` file when
a release is made, and the `new-notes` directory emptied to prepare for
development of the next release.

Between releases, running `make` in the `documentation` directory will combine
all the new entries into a single `RELEASE_NOTES.md` file that then gets
installed into the `doc` top-level directory.
That `make` command will also install the older `RELEASE-<version>.md` files
into the `doc` directory.
